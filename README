Benchmark for Minisketch.

To compile, first build Minisketch and copy over libminisketch.a and
minisketch.h. Then run make.

By default Minisketch uses -O2. We also use -O2 when building the executable.

To pin the executable to one CPU core, use cpuset(1). For example
	cpuset -l 0 ./decoding 100 1000 64
