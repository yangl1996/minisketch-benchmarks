Benchmark for Minisketch.

To compile, first build Minisketch and copy over libminisketch.a and
minisketch.h. Then run make.

By default Minisketch uses -O2. We als use -O2 when building the executable.

Note that the benchmark does not consider time to generate coded symbols. It
only measures the decoding time.
